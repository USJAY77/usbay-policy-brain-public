## PURPOSE
PB-087 creates Euria onboarding package templates.

## RISK
Missing templates could allow onboarding without evidence.

## POLICY LINK
AGENTS.md fail-closed, audit-first engineering, human oversight, rollback and forensics, network governance, backend truth source-of-truth, and secret/data hygiene rules. GitHub PB-041 through PB-050, Codex PB-051 through PB-060, Control Plane PB-061 through PB-070, Notion PB-071 through PB-080, and PB-040 connector readiness evidence.

## REQUIRED APPROVALS
USBAY-AUDIT and USBAY-GLOBAL23 review are required before merge. This PB does not authorize production activation, Euria API calls, credential creation, workspace/project mutations, or external mutations.

## GOVERNANCE CHECKS
JSON evidence must parse. Generated metadata, connector authority, workspace authority, execution authority, approval authority, audit authority, rollback authority, credential authority, fail-closed controls, activation boundary, evidence requirements, and required PR sections must validate.

## AUDIT
PB-087 generates package evidence.

## IMPACT
USBAY has package templates while live evidence remains missing.

## Decision
VERIFIED

## Status
READY_FOR_REVIEW
