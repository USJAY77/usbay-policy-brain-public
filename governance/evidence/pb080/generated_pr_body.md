## PURPOSE
PB-080 creates the Notion governance approval register.

## RISK
Missing approvals could be mistaken for authorization without a register.

## POLICY LINK
AGENTS.md fail-closed, audit-first engineering, human oversight, rollback and forensics, network governance, backend truth source-of-truth, and secret/data hygiene rules. GitHub PB-041 through PB-050, Codex PB-051 through PB-060, Control Plane PB-061 through PB-070, and PB-040 connector readiness evidence.

## REQUIRED APPROVALS
USBAY-AUDIT and USBAY-GLOBAL23 review are required before merge. This PB does not authorize production activation, Notion API calls, workspace mutations, page/database mutations, or credential creation.

## GOVERNANCE CHECKS
JSON evidence must parse. Generated metadata, connector authority, workspace authority, page authority, database authority, approval authority, audit authority, rollback authority, credential authority, fail-closed controls, activation boundary, evidence requirements, and required PR sections must validate.

## AUDIT
PB-080 generates approval register evidence.

## IMPACT
USBAY has an explicit approval ledger that blocks activation.

## Decision
VERIFIED

## Status
READY_FOR_REVIEW
