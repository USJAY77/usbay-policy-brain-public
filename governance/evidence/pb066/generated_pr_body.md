## PURPOSE
PB-066 defines Control Plane creation authority.

## RISK
Creation authority could be confused with production activation without explicit separation.

## POLICY LINK
AGENTS.md fail-closed, audit-first engineering, human oversight, rollback and forensics, trust-state isolation, backend truth source-of-truth, and secret/data hygiene rules. PB-038 connector framework, PB-039 orchestrator simulation, and PB-040 connector readiness assessment.

## REQUIRED APPROVALS
USBAY-AUDIT and USBAY-GLOBAL23 review are required before merge. This PB does not authorize production activation, credential creation, external API calls, live mutations, or Control Plane state changes.

## GOVERNANCE CHECKS
JSON evidence must parse. Generated metadata, authority model, execution authority, policy authority, approval authority, audit authority, rollback authority, credential authority, fail-closed controls, activation boundary, evidence requirements, and required PR sections must validate.

## AUDIT
PB-066 generates creation authority evidence.

## IMPACT
USBAY can approve authority creation only under controls.

## Decision
VERIFIED

## Status
READY_FOR_REVIEW
