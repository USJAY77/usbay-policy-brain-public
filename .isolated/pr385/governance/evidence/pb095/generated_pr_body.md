## PURPOSE
PB-095 validates LinkedIn onboarding in simulation.

## RISK
Simulation could be mistaken for live readiness if activation boundary is unclear.

## POLICY LINK
AGENTS.md fail-closed, audit-first engineering, human oversight, rollback and forensics, network governance, secret/data hygiene, and no false governance state rules. GitHub PB-041 through PB-050, Codex PB-051 through PB-060, Control Plane PB-061 through PB-070, Notion PB-071 through PB-080, Euria PB-081 through PB-090, and PB-040 connector readiness evidence.

## REQUIRED APPROVALS
USBAY-AUDIT and USBAY-GLOBAL23 review are required before merge. This PB does not authorize production activation, LinkedIn API calls, posting, messaging, credential creation, account mutation, or public action.

## GOVERNANCE CHECKS
JSON evidence must parse. Generated metadata, connector authority, account authority, publication authority, messaging authority, approval authority, audit authority, rollback authority, credential authority, reputation-risk controls, fail-closed controls, activation boundary, evidence requirements, and required PR sections must validate.

## AUDIT
PB-095 generates validation evidence.

## IMPACT
USBAY can begin preparation only, not activation.

## Decision
VERIFIED

## Status
READY_FOR_REVIEW
